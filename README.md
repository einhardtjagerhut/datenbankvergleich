## Redis ##
  
*    Written in: C
*    Main point: Blazing fast
*    License: BSD
*    Protocol: Telnet-like, binary safe
*    Disk-backed in-memory database,
*    Master-slave replication, automatic failover
*    Simple values or data structures by keys
*    but complex operations like ZREVRANGEBYSCORE.
*    INCR & co (good for rate limiting or statistics)
*    Bit and bitfield operations (for example to implement bloom filters)
*    Has sets (also union/diff/inter)
*    Has lists (also a queue; blocking pop)
*    Has hashes (objects of multiple fields)
*    Sorted sets (high score table, good for range queries)
*    Lua scripting capabilities
*    Has transactions
*    Values can be set to expire (as in a cache)
*    Pub/Sub lets you implement messaging
*    GEO API to query by radius (!) 

Best used:
>For rapidly changing data with a foreseeable database size (should fit mostly in memory).

For example:
>To store real-time stock prices. Real-time analytics. Leaderboards. Real-time communication. And wherever you used memcached before. 

## MongoDB ##

*    Written in: C++
*    Main point: JSON document store
*    License: AGPL (Drivers: Apache)
*    Protocol: Custom, binary (BSON)
*    Master/slave replication (auto failover with replica sets)
*    Sharding built-in
*    Queries are javascript expressions
*    Run arbitrary javascript functions server-side
*    Geospatial queries
*    Multiple storage engines with different performance characteristics
*    Performance over features
*    Document validation
*    Journaling
*    Powerful aggregation framework
*    On 32bit systems, limited to ~2.5Gb
*    Text search integrated
*    GridFS to store big data + metadata (not actually an FS)
*    Has geospatial indexing
*    Data center aware 

Best used: 
>If you need dynamic queries. If you prefer to define indexes, not map/reduce functions. If you need good performance on a big DB. If you wanted CouchDB, but your data changes too much, filling up disks.

For example:
> For most things that you would do with MySQL or PostgreSQL, but having predefined columns really holds you back. 

## Cassandra ##

*    Written in: Java
*    Main point: Store huge datasets in "almost" SQL
*    License: Apache
*    Protocol: CQL3 & Thrift
*    CQL3 is very similar to SQL, but with some limitations that come from the scalability (most notably: no JOINs, no aggregate functions.)
*    CQL3 is now the official interface. Don't look at Thrift, unless you're working on a legacy app. This way, you can live without understanding ColumnFamilies, SuperColumns, etc.
*    Querying by key, or key range (secondary indices are also available)
*    Tunable trade-offs for distribution and replication (N, R, W)
*    Data can have expiration (set on INSERT).
*    Writes can be much faster than reads (when reads are disk-bound)
*    Map/reduce possible with Apache Hadoop
*    All nodes are similar, as opposed to Hadoop/HBase
*    Very good and reliable cross-datacenter replication
*    Distributed counter datatype.
*    You can write triggers in Java. 
*
Best used: 
>When you need to store data so huge that it doesn't fit on server, but still want a friendly familiar interface to it.

For example: 
>Web analytics, to count hits by hour, by browser, by IP, etc. Transaction logging. Data collection from huge sensor arrays. 

## ElasticSearch ##

*    Written in: Java
*    Main point: Advanced Search
*    License: Apache
*    Protocol: JSON over HTTP (Plugins: Thrift, memcached)
*    Stores JSON documents
*    Has versioning
*    Parent and children documents
*    Documents can time out
*    Very versatile and sophisticated querying, scriptable
*    Write consistency: one, quorum or all
*    Sorting by score (!)
*    Geo distance sorting
*    Fuzzy searches (approximate date, etc) (!)
*    Asynchronous replication
*    Atomic, scripted updates (good for counters, etc)
*    Can maintain automatic "stats groups" (good for debugging) 

Best used: 
>When you have objects with (flexible) fields, and you need "advanced search" functionality.

For example: 
>A dating service that handles age difference, geographic location, tastes and dislikes, etc. Or a leaderboard system that depends on many variables. 

## CouchDB ##

*    Written in: Erlang
*    Main point: DB consistency, ease of use
*    License: Apache
*    Protocol: HTTP/REST
*    Bi-directional (!) replication,
*    continuous or ad-hoc,
*    with conflict detection,
*    thus, master-master replication. (!)
*    MVCC - write operations do not block reads
*    Previous versions of documents are available
*    Crash-only (reliable) design
*    Needs compacting from time to time
*    Views: embedded map/reduce
*    Formatting views: lists & shows
*    Server-side document validation possible
*    Authentication possible
*    Real-time updates via '_changes' (!)
*    Attachment handling
*    thus, CouchApps (standalone js apps) 

Best used: 
>For accumulating, occasionally changing data, on which pre-defined queries are to be run. Places where versioning is important.

For example: 
>CRM, CMS systems. Master-master replication is an especially interesting feature, allowing easy multi-site deployments. 

## HBase ##
